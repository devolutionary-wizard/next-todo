# Todo application

## Description

This is a Todo application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like adding, editing, and deleting todos. The application uses MySQL for data storage and integrates with various libraries such as Axios for HTTP requests, Drizzle ORM for database interactions, and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Motivation

The motivation behind building this project was to create a practical and efficient tool for task management. By developing this application, I aimed to enhance my skills in modern web development technologies and frameworks.

## Purpose

I built this project to provide a simple yet powerful solution for managing daily tasks. It serves as a practical example of how to integrate various technologies and libraries to create a full-stack application.

## Problem Solved

This application addresses the common problem of task management by providing a user-friendly interface to keep track of todos. It helps users organize their tasks, set priorities, and ensure nothing is forgotten.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Develop a full-stack application using Next.js and React.
- Integrate MySQL with a web application using Drizzle ORM.
- Manage state and perform asynchronous operations with React Query and Axios.
- Implement styling using TailwindCSS.
- Write clean, maintainable code and follow best practices in modern web development.
